hey idiots
dont you EVER
EVER
ask me for the flps
THEY'RE IN the "source_files" folder
the source_files folder also contains flas and chromatics n shit
so DON'T walk around like a bumbling fool asking for a gdrive link
also, chromatics are in wavs, none of that mp3 bullshit. plus, I've put some .fsc files in the FLPS for covers. DO. NOT. USE. UNOFFICIAL MIDIS. YOU. FUCKING. MORONS.
