The repository for FFO's canned build.

# FAQ:

"What is this mod about?"

It's a mod about FACE, a character based off of the placeholder "face" icons in the files of the game. I made an attempt, to say the least.

"Why do the songs sound so (insert description)?"

Mainly stupidity and overexecution of the mod.

"Why did you cancel it?"

Development was a slog and it became a mere shadow of itself. Anne's section was supposed to be a short one, but the song and concepts became so tedious to work on that I eventually have to make QRT a standalone one-shot mod.

"This looks so (insert description here)! (long and verbose rant on how I should kill myself because I made this mod and it was so badly executed that it made [writer]'s mom die)"

Trust me. You don't have to wait long X)!

# End notes

I should have never made this mod. But at least I gained some composing knowledge.
